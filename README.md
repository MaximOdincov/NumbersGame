# NumbersGame

NumbersGame is a simple Android game where the user must solve math problems by selecting the correct answer from a set of options within a certain time limit. The game features multiple difficulty levels and provides feedback on the user's performance.

This project was created as a learning exercise to explore and implement various Android development concepts, including:

- **Jetpack Navigation**: Used for managing navigation between fragments in the app.
- **View Binding**: Simplifies interactions with views by providing type-safe access to layout elements.
- **Data Binding**: Enables binding UI components in layouts to data sources, reducing boilerplate code.

## Features

- Solve math problems with increasing difficulty.
- Choose from four difficulty levels: Test, Easy, Normal, and Hard.
- Timer-based gameplay to challenge the user.
- Feedback on the number of correct answers and percentage of accuracy.
- Simple and intuitive UI.
